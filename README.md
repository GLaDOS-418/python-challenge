#Python Challenge
I've started solving the python challenges from [here](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).
Solution of every challenge leads to the link for the next challenge.
There is no authentication so, one can jump to any challenge directly from the link. 
The goal of every challenge is to introduce a new python concept/module/lib.

This repo contains jupyter notebooks which have the solutions for the challenges that I've solved.

main souces for learning that I'm using are:
1. [DiveIntoPython3] - super resource if you already know some language.
2. [python3 docs] - there ain't a more detailed doc.
3. stack overflow
