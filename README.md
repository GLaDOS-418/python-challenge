# Python Challenge

I've started solving the python challenges from [pythonchallenge.com](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).<br/>
Solution of every challenge leads to the link for the next challenge.<br/>
There is no authentication so, one can jump to any challenge directly from the link. <br/>
The goal of every challenge is to introduce a new python concept/module/lib.<br/>
<br/>
This repo contains jupyter notebooks which have the solutions for the challenges that I've solved.<br/>

main souces for learning that I'm using are:
1. [DiveIntoPython3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) - covers most of the topics.
2. [python3 docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) - there ain't a more detailed doc.
3. stack overflow
