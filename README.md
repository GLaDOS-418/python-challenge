# Python Challenge

* The repo contains the solutions for python challenges from [pythonchallenge.com](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) which I have solved.<br/>
* Solution of every challenge leads to the link for the next challenge.<br/>
* There is no authentication so, one can jump to any challenge directly from the link. <br/>
* The goal of every challenge is to introduce a new python concept/module/lib.<br/>

A few sources that I've used:
1. [DiveIntoPython3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/)
2. [python3 docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
3. [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)
